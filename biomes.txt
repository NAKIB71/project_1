Biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living organisms. To help make sense of distribution patterns, biogeographers may divide the world into different biomes.A biome is a global community of biological organisms living within a similar type of climate.Temperature range, soil type, and the amount of light and water are unique to a particular place and form the niches for specific species allowing scientists to define the biome.
